## Tech Job Search Web Scraper

**1. Sumamry of Idea**

We will create a CLI app that will build a web scraper from job search sites online like monster.com, indeed.com, etc. We will collect data for job listings in the tech industry such as company name, skills, education level, salary detail, etc. and then allow users to search for jobs by keyword, save jobs they are interested in, and run the job's data through AI to produce a sample cover letter for that job.

**2. What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)** 

Helps users find relevant and recent job listings in the tech industry, select listings they like, and then prompt AI to process the listing's data to produce a sample cover letter for the given job posting.

**3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition. What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**

Features that allow user to enter data (like required programming language, postings by state, etc.) to filter and view job listings within the past 48 hours, saving posts they like to a "keep" folder, and then prompting AI to create a sample cover letter for the selected job posting.

**Additional ideas/notes:**

Tie in an AI search. Given x criteria, can AI filter the criteria. 

Location-based, within past 48 hours, have AI take data from job posting and write a cover letter or template cover letter for that job.
Checkbox the job applications you want to filter data for.

Search job postings for required tech language(s).

## Amazon data scraper

**1. Sumamry of Idea**

We will create a CLI app that will show the user the total amount they have spent at Amazon over all time. Given some personal info (name, salary, household) scrape Amazon and return the data for executing a healthy average of what to spend


**2. What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)** 

Helps users understand the impact of their Amazon spending and prompt questions for behavior change.

## Notebook Data Analysis

**1. Sumamry of Idea**

We will create a Jupyter notebook that will import a scraped Amazon personal spending dataset. We'll aim to display high level data stories comparing the Amazon data with pre-determined percentages/scale that will show user results.

Pitch 2 idea (CLI):
scrape Amazon personal spending dataset
given some personal info (name, salary, household) scrape Amazon and return the data for executing a healthy average of what to spend
Stretching Goals-
Input budget for year, import wish list and spread across the year
