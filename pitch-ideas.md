## Tech Job Search Web Scraper

**1. Sumamry of Idea**

We will create a CLI app that will build a web scraper from job search sites online like monster.com, indeed.com, etc. We will collect data for job listings in the tech industry such as company name, skills, education level, salary detail, etc. and then allow users to search for jobs by keyword, save jobs they are interested in, and run the job's data through AI to produce a sample cover letter for that job.

**2. What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)** 

Helps users find relevant and recent job listings in the tech industry, select listings they like, and then prompt AI to process the listing's data to produce a sample cover letter for the given job posting.

**3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition. What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**

Features that allow user to enter data (like required programming language, postings by state, etc.) to filter and view job listings within the past 48 hours, saving posts they like to a "keep" folder, and then prompting AI to create a sample cover letter for the selected job posting.

## Pitch for Final

1. Summary of Idea

We are proposing to create a web application that will scrape job sites for data and use AI to write cover letters. The application will allow users to search for jobs by keyword, save jobs they are interested in, and run the job's data along with their resume through AI to produce a sample cover letter for that job. 

2. What problem or pain point does it solve?

The application solves the problem of finding relevant and recent job listings in the tech industry, and generating sample cover letters for those listings. It also saves users time by automating the process of finding and applying for jobs.

3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition

The MVP of the application will include the following features:

- Ability to search for jobs by keyword
- Ability to save job listings to a "keep" folder
- Ability to generate a sample cover letter for a selected job listing
- The MVP will be sufficient to demonstrate the feasibility of the application and its potential to solve the problem of finding and applying for jobs in the tech industry.



## Stretch Goals

- Ability to filter job listings by location, job title, and other criteria
- Ability to generate multiple sample cover letters for a single job listing
- Ability to customize the sample cover letters with the user's personal information
- Ability to track the user's job application progress
- Ability to connect with recruiters and hiring managers
- We believe that the application has the potential to be a valuable tool for tech job seekers. We are excited to develop the application and bring it to market.
